# Unofficial Oxford MPhys Finals Solutions
[![CC BY-NC 4.0][cc-by-nc-shield]][cc-by-nc]

Are you:
- Worried about the upcoming Physics Prelims/Finals?
- Curious about what the past papers are like?
- A visitor who ended up here perchance?

This repository contains a collection of unofficial solutions of the Oxford MPhys exams, neatly typeset in TeX for convenience.
Inspired by [the initiative by current students](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OZb9W9EgwbjtaeoD2Q31E9e0S4R3wQVG) and [a blog by an alumnus](https://liziyan1117.com/page/).

The structure of this repository is as follows:
```
Root
│   Custom Exam TeX Class (thelongcat_exam_solution.cls)
└───Course Code (e.g. C2)
    └───Year (e.g. C2_2024)
```
where ```Year``` can be either a folder of source TeX files or an automatically compiled PDF.

Being unofficial, I cannot guarantee that the presented solutions are 100% correct.
However I am happy to discuss the eventual typos and errors, just kindly raise an issue [here](https://github.com/thelongcatz/Oxford-MPhys-Exam-Solutions/issues), and remember to mention which answer of which paper is having issues.
