	\part \todo In X-ray transitions, holes are introduced in inner shell $\electron$ and the resulting radiation from the hole transition is X-ray.
	
	Transition energy:
	\begin{equation*}
		E_{nm} = hcR_\infty \sbracket{\frac{(Z-\sigma_n)^2}{n^2} - \frac{(Z-\sigma_m)^2}{m^2}}
	\end{equation*}
	
	The form of the energy resembles the hydrogenic energy level as the inner shell $\electron$ are symmetric, causing the system to be largely central.
	
	The parameters $\sigma_n$ and $\sigma_m$ are the shielding term that quantifies the effect of shielding by other inner shell $\electron$.
	For $K$ shell, $\sigma \simeq 2$.
	
	The $K_\alpha$ radiation is the transition from $K$ shell to $L$ shell ($n=1 \to 2$).
	
	K absorption edge?
